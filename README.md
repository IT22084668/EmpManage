Second Year final group project was to create a Web application for real client. So we found a startup company named Protons Electronic and Electricals. My part was to create employee manager function and here is the finished product

In this part is managed by admin. An employee cannot self-register to the company. He has to face interview series and if only he selected the admin will enter him to the system. In here company keep the personal details of employees and their salary calculation will happen in here. Admin can add employees, edit employees details and delete employees from the system.
In salary calculation part system actively keep the employeeâ€™s overtime work hours, EPF, ETF and basic salary. Through a calculation process in 25th of every month salary will be automatically calculate and added to a new table.
